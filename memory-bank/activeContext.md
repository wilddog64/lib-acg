# Active Context — lib-acg

## Current Branch: `fix/next-improvements-6`

**Repo created:** 2026-04-25  
**Status:** PR #27 merged to main (2026-05-23, `7c17da72`); enforce_admins restored on main; next branch active (`fix/next-improvements-6`).

- **COMPLETE:** `playwright/acg_extend.js` now waits 2 seconds before checking for the "Session extended" toast and increases the visible window to 15s in the immediate path and 10s in the non-immediate path, matching the async server response timing; committed as `e635d1e` (`fix(acg-extend): increase toast detection timeout — async server response arrives after 5s window`) and pushed to `origin/fix/next-improvements-5`. Validation used `node --check playwright/acg_extend.js`.

- **COMPLETE:** `playwright/acg_credentials.js` now removes the toast-dismiss block from `_waitForCredentials`, leaving only the credential-input polling and preserving the `addLocatorHandler` toast handling for pointer actions; committed as `08f322e` (`fix(acg-credentials): remove toast dismiss from _waitForCredentials — DOM queries are never blocked by overlays`) and pushed to `origin/fix/next-improvements-5`. Validation used `node --check playwright/acg_credentials.js`.

- **COMPLETE:** `playwright/acg_extend.js`, `playwright/acg_credentials.js`, and `playwright/acg_restart.js` now anchor the "Session extended" toast dismiss on the leaf text node and closest button-bearing ancestor, fixing the broad `:has-text()` selector that could click the wrong button; committed as `bf57ee1` (`fix(acg): anchor toast dismiss on leaf text + XPath ancestor — broad :has-text selector clicked wrong button`) and pushed to `origin/fix/next-improvements-5`. Validation used `node --check playwright/acg_extend.js`, `node --check playwright/acg_credentials.js`, and `node --check playwright/acg_restart.js`.

- **COMPLETE:** `bin/acg-extend-test` now runs `node` normally, parses `--provider` from the remaining args, and re-validates AWS credentials with `aws sts get-caller-identity` after extend for AWS runs so broken sessions fail fast before `make all`/`make up` continue; committed as `0344eb3` (`fix(acg-extend-test): drop exec — add AWS credential re-validation after extend`) and pushed to `origin/fix/next-improvements-5`. Validation used `shellcheck -S warning bin/acg-extend-test`.

- **COMPLETE:** `playwright/acg_extend.js`, `playwright/acg_credentials.js`, and `playwright/acg_restart.js` now use Playwright locator handlers to dismiss the "Session extended" toast, and `acg_extend.js` now replaces the DOM evaluate dismiss path with a locator-based close button click in both immediate and non-immediate exit paths; committed as `e66d028` (`fix(acg): replace DOM evaluate toast dismiss with Playwright locator + addLocatorHandler`) and pushed to `origin/fix/next-improvements-5`. Validation used `node --check playwright/acg_extend.js`, `node --check playwright/acg_credentials.js`, and `node --check playwright/acg_restart.js`.

- **COMPLETE:** `playwright/acg_extend.js` now waits for the "Session extended" toast to appear and dismisses it before exiting in both the immediate and non-immediate paths, preventing the toast from persisting into the next CDP-backed script run; committed as `97fca3c` (`fix(acg-extend): dismiss Session extended toast before exit — it persists and blocks next script`) and pushed to `origin/fix/next-improvements-5`. Validation used `node --check playwright/acg_extend.js`.

- **COMPLETE:** `playwright/acg_credentials.js` now re-opens the panel inside `_waitForCredentials` when `Open Sandbox` becomes visible again, dismissing any dialog and re-clicking `Open Sandbox` so the credential wait no longer hangs after the panel closes; committed as `7d04391` (`fix(acg-credentials): re-open panel inside waitForCredentials when Open Sandbox button reappears`) and pushed to `origin/fix/next-improvements-5`. Validation used `node --check playwright/acg_credentials.js`.

- **COMPLETE:** `playwright/acg_credentials.js` and `playwright/acg_restart.js` now dismiss the "Session extended" success toast in addition to the existing "Extend Your Session" dialog, and `acg_credentials.js` now pre-dismisses plus `force: true` clicks `Open Sandbox` so the toast no longer blocks pointer events; committed as `e5e38d6` (`fix(acg): dismiss Session extended toast — it shares alertdialog role and blocks Open Sandbox click`) and pushed to `origin/fix/next-improvements-5`. Validation used `node --check playwright/acg_credentials.js` and `node --check playwright/acg_restart.js`.

- **COMPLETE:** `playwright/acg_extend.js` now uses `_cdpBrowser.close()` instead of `_cdpBrowser.disconnect()` for the CDP cleanup path, matching Playwright's connectOverCDP behavior and avoiding the `disconnect is not a function` error; committed as `52dffbc` (`fix(acg-extend): replace .disconnect() with .close() — CDP Browser has no disconnect method`) and pushed to `origin/fix/next-improvements-5`. Validation used `node --check playwright/acg_extend.js`.

- **COMPLETE:** `playwright/acg_restart.js` now polls for `Delete Sandbox` after `Open Sandbox` and dismisses the "Extend Your Session" dialog on every 500 ms tick until the button appears, replacing the one-shot `waitForSelector` path that could stall behind a late modal; committed as `a9cb1c1` (`fix(acg-restart): poll + dismiss Extend dialog while waiting for Delete Sandbox button`) and pushed to `origin/fix/next-improvements-5`. Validation used `node --check playwright/acg_restart.js`.

- **COMPLETE:** `playwright/acg_restart.js` now scrolls the `Delete Sandbox` button back into view and retries the click up to 3 times with an 800 ms settle pause, preventing the panel animation viewport shift from leaving the element outside the viewport; committed as `fd50c7f` (`fix(acg-restart): scroll + retry Delete Sandbox click — panel animation causes viewport shift`) and pushed to `origin/fix/next-improvements-5`. Validation used `node --check playwright/acg_restart.js`.

- **MERGED PR #27** — `fix/next-improvements-5` → main (`7c17da72`). Playwright automation reliability: toast dismissal architecture fixed (removed blocking dismiss from polling loop, consolidated to `addLocatorHandler` handlers), CDP Browser lifecycle corrected (`close()` instead of `disconnect()`), credential re-validation added to extend-test. 14 inter-related toast/CDP bugs collapsed to single coherent fix. Copilot caught button-selection ambiguity + disconnect guard. Retrospective: `docs/retro/2026-05-23-pr27-retrospective.md`.

- **MERGED PR #26** — `fix/next-improvements-4` → main (`fbcecc24`). Visibility guard fix for "Extend Your Session" dialog detection: added CSS check (`offsetParent !== null && getComputedStyle(d).display !== 'none'`) to `_dismissExtendYourSessionDialog`. Copilot caught incomplete fix (guard missing from `.find()` selection path). Retrospective: `docs/retro/2026-05-23-pr26-retrospective.md`.

- **MERGED PR #23** — `fix/next-improvements` → main (`48afc0a4`). Two usability fixes: credential masking in terminal output (`bin/acg-credential-test` + `sed 's/=.*/=***/'`); extraction progress visibility in `playwright/acg_credentials.js` (`inputs.first().evaluate()` guarantees same-node evaluation). Copilot review caught locator divergence (Playwright CDN vs file-based) and CHANGELOG wording precision. All threads resolved cleanly. Retrospective: `docs/retro/2026-05-22-fix-credential-masking-retrospective.md`.
